## Abstract

Cities across Europe are pursuing car-reduction and car-free policies in response to climate, health, and livability challenges. However, many such interventions—ranging from Low Traffic Neighbourhoods to congestion charging and parking restrictions—have produced uneven outcomes and significant political backlash. These failures are often framed as issues of public resistance or poor communication, but a deeper structural problem persists: urban mobility regulations remain static, prescriptive, and insufficiently responsive to local urban dynamics.

At the same time, cities now generate unprecedented volumes of spatial, mobility, environmental, and socio-economic data through BIM, GIS, transport systems, and real-time sensing. Despite this, regulatory frameworks rarely learn from observed outcomes. This paper proposes a learning-based approach to urban regulation, drawing an analogy to recent breakthroughs in scientific discovery systems such as DeepMind’s AlphaFold. Rather than prescribing urban form or transport solutions, the proposed framework seeks to learn the underlying conditions under which low-car and car-free environments succeed or fail.

Using London as a pilot context, the framework conceptualizes the city as an evolving graph of streets, blocks, land uses, transport access, and human movement. By integrating spatial data, mobility patterns, and outcome metrics (accessibility, economic activity, environmental quality, and social equity), the system enables simulation and evaluation of regulatory scenarios before political implementation. The aim is to shift urban policy from ideology-driven prohibition toward evidence-based performance regulation.

The paper outlines a governance-conscious research framework in which AI systems support, rather than replace, human decision-making. A proposed borough-scale pilot demonstrates how adaptive, transparent, and accountable learning systems could inform future low-car regulations while preserving democratic oversight. This work positions learning-based urban regulation as a necessary next step in the evolution of planning practice for complex cities.

## 1. The Limits of Static Urban Mobility Regulation

Urban mobility regulation in London—and in most global cities—has historically relied on static, prescriptive rules. These include fixed parking standards, road hierarchies, traffic restrictions, and vehicle access controls applied uniformly across diverse urban contexts. While such regulations were effective in an era of lower complexity and slower change, they are increasingly misaligned with contemporary urban realities.

Recent car-reduction initiatives, including Low Traffic Neighbourhoods, congestion pricing expansions, and parking removal schemes, reveal a recurring pattern. In some locations, these measures deliver substantial improvements in air quality, public health, and street life. In others, they generate displacement effects, economic stress, accessibility failures, and strong political opposition. Importantly, these divergent outcomes occur even when similar policies are applied within the same city.

This inconsistency is often attributed to public resistance, behavioural inertia, or insufficient consultation. However, such explanations overlook a more fundamental issue: current regulatory systems lack the capacity to learn from their own outcomes. Regulations are typically defined in advance, implemented uniformly, and revised only after prolonged political cycles. Feedback—when it exists—is qualitative, delayed, and weakly linked to the regulatory mechanisms that produced the observed effects.

Meanwhile, cities like London now possess extensive datasets describing their physical form, mobility behaviour, environmental performance, and economic activity. Detailed street networks, land-use models, public transport accessibility metrics, footfall data, air quality measurements, and anonymised travel patterns are routinely collected. Yet these datasets are rarely integrated into a continuous learning loop capable of informing adaptive regulation.

As a result, urban mobility policy oscillates between ideological certainty and political retreat. Car use is either discouraged through blunt instruments or re-entrenched through compromise, without a rigorous understanding of where, why, and under what conditions low-car environments genuinely succeed.
